    <p style="width: 50%">
      Spaghetti is made from ground grain (flour) and water. Whole-wheat and
      multigrain spaghetti are also available.At its simplest, imitation
      spaghetti can be formed using no more than a rolling pin and a knife. A
      home pasta machine simplifies the rolling and makes the cutting more
      uniform. But of course cutting sheets produces pasta with a rectangular
      rather than a cylindrical cross-section and the result is a variant of
      fettucine. Some pasta machines have a spaghetti attachment with circular
      holes that extrude spaghetti or shaped rollers that form cylindrical
      noodles. Spaghetti can be made by hand by manually rolling a ball of dough
      on a surface to make a long sausage shape. The ends of the sausage are
      pulled apart to make a long thin sausage. The ends are brought together
      and the loop pulled to make two long sausages. The process is repeated
      until the pasta is sufficiently thin. The pasta knobs at each end are cut
      off leaving many strands which may be hung up to dry. Fresh spaghetti
      would normally be cooked within hours of being formed. Commercial versions
      of fresh spaghetti are manufactured.

    <h3>Penne Pasta</h3>

    <p style="width: 50%">
      Penne (Italian: [ˈpenːe]) is an extruded type of pasta with
      cylinder-shaped pieces, their ends cut at an angle. Penne is the plural
      form of the Italian penna (meaning feather but pen as well), deriving from
      Latin penna (meaning "feather" or "quill"), and is a cognate of the
      English word pen. When this format was created, it was intended to imitate
      the then-ubiquitous fountain pen's steel nibs.In Italy, penne are produced
      in two main variants: penne lisce (smooth) and penne rigate (furrowed),
      the latter having ridges on each penna. Pennoni ("big quills") is a wider
      version of penne. In English-language contexts, a version is called
      mostaccioli by various manufacturers, which may be either smooth or ridged
      in texture. Penne is traditionally cooked al dente and its shape makes it
      particularly adapted for sauces, such as pesto, marinara, or arrabbiata.
      The latter has been celebrated several times in Italian movies, notably in
      Marco Ferrari's La Grande Bouffe and Federico Fellini's Roma.
